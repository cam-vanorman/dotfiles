# dotfiles
Inspired and based off of [@kaidesu](git@github.com:kaidesu/dotfiles.git). I've been using this for a while now and it's been a great experience.

> **Note:** You will need to go through each dotfile to personalize it to your liking, GPG signing key, name, and email.


## Installation
```
# Clone project to your home directory
git clone git@github.com:cam-vanorman/dotfiles.git ~/.dotfiles

# Change directories
cd ~/.dotfiles

# Run the installer
./install.sh
```
